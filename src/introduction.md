# Introduction

MXMLExtrema MXMLC provides an enhanced compiler infrastructure for the Adobe AIR software development kit. The Adobe AIR SDK is known to ship a legacy Flex compiler that is left most unmaintained.

MXMLExtrema MXMLShare is how you indirectly use MXMLC in the form of a package manager intended for Adobe AIR and its native extensions.

For contributors, it requires no setup other than the Rust systems language.
